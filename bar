GITHUB - HOW TO MAKE SUBLIME TEXT OPEN FROM TERMINAL

open -a /Applications/Sublime\ Text.app
If Sublime Text opens, all is good with your setup. After that, we just need to add one line to your .bash_profile, and youâ€™re good to go.

#open up .bash_profile for editing
nano ~/.bash_profile
#add this command to the end of .bash_profile
alias sublime="open -a /Applications/Sublime\ Text.app"
#then run this command to refresh the .bash_profile with this new command
source ~/.bash_profile

Then go to terminal and type 
==> sublime <file-name>
